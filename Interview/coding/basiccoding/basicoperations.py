Hey every one by seeing this program itself you can write the code and i think you ad understood 
about the input is taken and assigned it to the output too,now we are going to discuss about the
arithmatic operations.
We are going to take the two variables and perform the add,sub,mutiplication,division,floor,
power operation too """
